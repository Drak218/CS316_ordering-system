ðŸ“Œ Notes

Ensure MySQL is running and the ordering_system_db database is created manually if migrations are not used.

The backend serves as an API; all user interaction happens via the Vue frontend.

Make sure CORS is properly configured in Laravel if you run into frontend-backend communication issues.
